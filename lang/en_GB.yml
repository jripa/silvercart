    Description: |
        Use this upload form to upload many images of different products at once.
        The images will be automatically assigned if you name them like described below:

        [productnumber].png/jpg/jpeg
        OR
        [productnumber]-[consecutive number].png/jpg/jpeg
        OR
        [productnumber]-[consecutive number]-[short-description-without-whitespaces].png/jpg/jpeg

        [short-description-without-whitespaces] is optional and is used for search engine optimization (SEO), to reach a better visibility on search engines like Google.
        If [short-description-without-whitespaces] is empty, the product title will be used instead.

        Example:
        You want to add 4 images for the products 502.133.66.5 and 758.500.08.9. Three of them should get an own SEO description.
        You want to add 1 image for the products 128.000.01.7 and 542.550.08.1.
        The filenames of your images should be set like mentioned below:

        502.133.66.5-1.png
        502.133.66.5-2-coffee-machine-XYZ-front-side.png
        502.133.66.5-3-coffee-machine-XYZ-left-side.png
        502.133.66.5-4-coffee-machine-XYZ-right-side.png
        758.500.08.9-1.png
        758.500.08.9-2.png
        758.500.08.9-3.png
        758.500.08.9-4.png
        128.000.01.7.png
        542.550.08.1.png

        The image with the consecutive number 1 will be used for product overview pages.
        Already existing images of affected products will be deleted when using this function.
